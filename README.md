Project Overview 🌐
A real-time chat application using Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, and WebSocket allows users to send and receive messages instantly. Here’s how each component fits into the project:

1. Spring Boot 🚀
Spring Boot simplifies the setup and development of Spring applications. It provides:

Dependency Management: Automatically manages dependencies.
Embedded Servers: Includes embedded servers like Tomcat.
Auto-Configuration: Automatically configures the application based on the dependencies.
2. Thymeleaf 📄
Thymeleaf is a modern server-side Java template engine for creating dynamic HTML content. It integrates seamlessly with Spring Boot to:

Render Views: Dynamically generate HTML pages.
Template Processing: Process templates with data from the server.
3. WebSocket 🔗
WebSocket provides full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection, making it perfect for real-time applications. It enables:

Real-Time Communication: Instant message exchange between clients and servers.
Low Latency: Reduces the delay in message transmission.
How It All Fits Together 🧩
Spring Boot Application: The core of the application, handling all the backend logic.
WebSocket Configuration: Sets up WebSocket endpoints for real-time communication.
Thymeleaf Templates: Creates the frontend interface where users can send and receive messages.
Workflow 🔄
User Interaction: Users interact with the chat interface rendered by Thymeleaf.
Message Sending: When a user sends a message, it's captured by the WebSocket endpoint.
Real-Time Updates: The message is broadcast to all connected users instantly via WebSocket.
Dynamic Content: Thymeleaf dynamically updates the chat interface with new messages.
Benefits 🏆
Real-Time Communication: Instant message delivery.
Scalability: Easily scale the application with Spring Boot.
User-Friendly Interface: Thymeleaf ensures a dynamic and responsive UI.
